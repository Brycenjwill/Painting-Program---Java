# Overview

My basic java painting program allows the user to draw different colors to the screen. Using the arrow keys, the user can change colors, and 
the new color will be shown on the top left of the screen. The program uses JFrame as a base to paint on, as well as several event listeners
to track mouse and key presses. This program is rather rudimentary, as it was built as an introduction project for myself into Java. For 
anyone trying to learn Java, I recommend spending several weeks learning the basic Java program layout and rules before attempting a more
complex program.
